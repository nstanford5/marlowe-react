## Common Issues

### 400 Bad Request
1. Your contract creation request is malformed. Check the types that you are inputting to your Smart Contract.

2. Have you been developing for a few days? Check your timeouts have not expired in your Smart Contract.

### 403 Forbidden
The address that is making the request is not allowed to perform that action. You may have incorrectly specified which wallet is interacting with the Smart Contract. TODO -- In this repository connecting a wallet does not yet guarantee that wallet is authorized to interact with the SC. Different browser extensions will have different implementations of this, because of multiple wallet address features.

### 404 not found
The contract cannot be located in the runtime instance -- likely you need to wait for the creation txn to finish confirming.

### Nami wallet not recognized by getInstalledWalletExtensions()

### Uncaught runtime errors
#### "name":"SyntaxError" ... Error in $.contract...
There is a syntax error in the creation of your contract. Check the Contract.tsx for syntax errors in the JSON
